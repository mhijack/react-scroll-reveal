# react-scroll-review

DANGER!!! In development mode.

Not even phase 1 yet. I will work on this whenever I have time.
I want to take the same approach react-transition-group and react-router are taking: **render props** cause I really like them, and they are very flexible in comparison to higher-order-components (HOC). If you work with React and use React developer tool, you'll realize once you introduce HOC in your application, the level of nesting will hinder the readability of the developer tool greatly. Each HOC will introduce at least 2 levels of nesting to your application, and it becomes very difficult to find the component you need. (THe search function will only list out the components that contain attributes matching your keyword, erasing other elements in the inspector).

# TODO

    1. Figure out how to get reference to children (single/multiple children case)
    2. Error handling (edge cases)
    3.
